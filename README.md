to start app 
you will need to
 npm install on api
 yarn install on ui
turn on your mongo engine
and then 
 npm run dev on api
 yarn start on ui

the ui will be on port 3000 and the api on 3001

i have provide a postman collection for testing the api hope that is convenient.


happy review, sorry for not finishing all on 100% the time was really tricky on this challenge.
